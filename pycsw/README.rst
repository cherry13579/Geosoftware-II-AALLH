pycsw is an OGC CSW server implementation written in Python.

pycsw fully implements the OpenGIS Catalogue Service Implementation 
Specification (Catalogue Service for the Web). Initial development started in 
2010 (more formally announced in 2011). The project is certified OGC 
Compliant, and is an OGC Reference Implementation.  Since 2015, pycsw is an 
official OSGeo Project.

pycsw allows for the publishing and discovery of geospatial metadata via 
numerous APIs (CSW 2/CSW 3, OpenSearch, OAI-PMH, SRU). Existing repositories 
of geospatial metadata can also be exposed, providing a standards-based 
metadata and catalogue component of spatial data infrastructures.

pycsw is Open Source, released under an MIT license, and runs on all major 
platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).

Please read the docs at http://pycsw.org/docs for more information.

## Geosoftware II Project of the Group "A²HL²", WWU ##

[Aysel Tandik](https://github.com/atlanta11950), [Anika Graupner](https://github.com/Anika2), [Henry Fock](https://github.com/HenFo), [Lia Kirsch](https://github.com/cherry13579), [Lukas Jahnich](https://github.com/lukasjah)

**Project order:**    
   
This project will close the gap between geospatial data formats and repositories respectively geospatial metadata catalogues and similarity measurements. Project groups will extend an existing Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project with the functionality to retrieve and view similar records. This comprises both the API and UI, namely providing an HTTP endpoint to retrieve an ordered list of records based on a provided record and displaying/linking similar records in a detail view of a record respectively.

For our project we decide to extend pycsw.
